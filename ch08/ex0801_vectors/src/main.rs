/// data structures in Rustâ€™s standard library that can contain multiple values are called collections
/// the amount of data they contain can grow or shrink as the program runs
/// types of collections:
/// (1) vector -> allows to store a variable number of values next to each other
/// (2) string -> a collection of characters
/// (3) hash map allows to associate a value with a particular key
/// 
/// Storing Lists of Values with Vectors
/// vectors, aka Vec<T>, allow to store more than one value in a single data structure
/// that puts all the values next to each other in memory
